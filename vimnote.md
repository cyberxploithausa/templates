### **2. Use Tab Completion to Open Files**
- Type `:e ` (short for `:edit`) then press `Tab` repeatedly to cycle through files in the current directory.  
  ```
  :e myfile.txt
  ```
- You can also use wildcards:
  ```
  :e *.txt
  ```

---

### **3. Open a File from a List (Command Menu)**
- Press `:Ctrl+d` after typing `:e` to list available files in the directory.
  ```
  :e (then press Ctrl+d)
  ```
  This will show all matching files, and you can type the name to open one.

### **4. Switch Between Open Files**
- **List open files (buffers)**: `:ls`

---

### **5. Open a File in a Split**
- **Open in a horizontal split**: `:split filename`
